Howdy!

I'm Anne, a Canada-based designer who loves experienting with different creative mediums. 

This is my first 'handcraft' portfolio on Github so I'm still new and have a lot to learn. 

I hope you enjoy my website and feel free to contact me if you're interested in knowing more about what I do.

Thanks for stopping by!
Anne
